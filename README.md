# Part 1. Intro to HTML. 
#### Below is a sort of checklist to help me keep track what I have and haven't done so far. Included little tidbits of notes for future me to look back on. Descriptions found from provided sites as well as w3schools.com.
---
## Document metadata
- [x] title (Title of page that will show up within the tab.)
- [x] meta (Metadata that will not be shown to user but instead given to the browser.)
- [x] link (usually <link> is used to link a stylesheet, but since we're not using CSS, you can use it to link a favicon instead. The favicon is the image that is seen within the tab next to the title of the page)
 
## Content sectioning
- [x] main (Signifies the main content of the document. The content inside should be unique and not repeated elsewhere or within)
